URL-aware behavior:
- If the query contains specific URL(s), this tool automatically routes to focused URL extraction (Tavily Extract).
- URL only (e.g. "https://example.com/page"): extract that page directly.
- Query + URL (e.g. "summarize pricing https://example.com/pricing"): extract and rerank content for the query.
- Natural-language query without URL: search with Tavily.

Query formulation best practices:
- Keep queries concise (under 400 chars). Use search keywords, not full sentences.
- Use keyword-focused phrasing: "OpenAI GPT-5 release date ${new Date().getFullYear()}" not "Can you tell me when OpenAI will release GPT-5?"
- If you need a year and the user did not specify one, use only ${new Date().getFullYear()}. Do not add older years or multi-year ranges unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Break complex topics into separate focused searches (overview, recent developments, specifics, verification).
- For current events or news, use topic="news" and time_range when relevant.`,
